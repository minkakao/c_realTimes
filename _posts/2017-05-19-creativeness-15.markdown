description: <p><h4>Un-than Ma-than, " Value of Valueless" </h4></p> <p> I usually do a lot of "useless things". I make installation art and drawings. There are tons of drawings at home that are covered in dust, but I still make sketches. One day, I began to question these behaviors. Why am I  carried away by these personal works of art rather than on productive works that society pursues for weigh the profitability of it? What kind of attraction keeps people from continuing their own creative activities? I arranged an exhibition on curiosity and desire to collect their works and interview them.</p> <p>I collected works from people who created their works by making their own 'obnoxious things'. Some of the exhibitors made songs, and some made card games out of Korea’s political issues. The works of so many people gathered; people who gives handmade calendar to acquaintances, people who makes beautiful earrings, people who paints, people who writes poetry, calligraphy,  makes magazines, and so on.</p> <p>All the works contained the enthusiasm and vitality of the creator. Now, in the gray city, the creations exude a unique energy. Their energy is conveyed to the audience. One of my acquaintances rated it as the best among all exhibition works he had seen recently. In a city without color, he said, "I felt energy and a unique concentration and enthusiasm of the artists.”</p> <p>I think that perhaps what is judged to be useless and worthless is more worthy to an individual’s life than reasonable calculations. The present age pursues rational human character. They say to plan before acting and invest in something economically valuable. But the activities that make our lives colorful are never 'profitable'. Even if others say it is useless, it is not the case for the parties.'Obnoxious things', ‘hobbies’, and 'parties' bring enthusiasm to the daily life. 'Obnoxious things' are never worthless. It gives us the power to infuse life into our lives and lead it in our own way. It stimulates other stimuli and senses in life.</p>
