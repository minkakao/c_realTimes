description: <h5>Look around you. What color are people wearing?</h5><br><p>One day, I looked around. Surprisingly, certainly realized people are wearing mono-tone clothes. I could hardly find a person who is wearing light-color t-shirts or pants with vivid colors as pink, green, light blue etc. Everyone was wearing black, white, navy or grey. </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>At that moment, I drew a fun picture in my mind. What if most of the people around me dyed their hair in various colors? Won't it be fascinating if people wear colorful t-shirts and pants, dying hair in rainbow colors, wearing star-shaped glasses, and pink contact-lenses? Why does it seems there are so little colors around us? </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>Having been curious about why there are few colors around society, I planned an exhibition that shows colorfulness. So I gathered all colorful objects from people around me. Red trousers, blue socks, yellow t-shirts, green box and so on. Various objects were wearing different colors. </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">  <p> Furthermore, I planned a special event that visitors could put on various color lipsticks. Visitors could put green, yellow, blue, black, white lipsticks on their lip and leave their kiss mark as a visitor's signature. At the end of the exhibition, the collection of the kiss mark showed a colorfulness in our society. The variety of the colored lips pointed out the variety of characteristics each individual have, just like the different colors that people have.</p>
