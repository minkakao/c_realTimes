description: <h5>Look around you. What color are people wearing?</h5><br><p>One day, I looked around. Surprisingly, certainly realized people are wearing mono-tone clothes. I could hardly find a person who is wearing light-color t-shirts or pants like pink, green, light-blue, and so on. Everyone was wearing black, white, or grey. </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>At that moment, I drew fun picture in my mind. What if a most of the people around me dyed their hair in various colors? Won't it be extremely exciting if people wear colorful t-shirts and pants, dye hair in rainbow color, wear star-shape glasses, and wear pink contact-lenses? Why are there so little color around us ? </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>Having been curious about why there are few colors around society, I planned an exhibition that show colorfulness. So I gathered all colorful objects from people around me. Red trouser, blue socks, yellow t-shirts, green box... there were so many objects wearing colors. </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">  <p> Also, I planned a special event that people who comes to see exhibition can put on colorful lipstick and kiss their color onto a paper. Visitors put green, yellow, blue, black, white lipstick on their lip and kissed on a paper. It was really fun to watch people's various-colored lips.</p>
