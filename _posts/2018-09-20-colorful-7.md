description: <h5>Look around you. What color are people wearing?</h5><br><p>One day, I looked around. Surprisingly, certainly realized almost all people were wearing monotone clothes. I could hardly find a person who is wearing vivid color t-shirts or pants such as pink, green, light blue and so on. Everyone was wearing black, white, navy or grey. </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>At that moment, the desire of "COLOR" filled up my mind. It seemed there is lack of color around us, at least not enough for "VARIETY". White, navy, black, grey (monotone colors) were occupying the 'land of color'. </p>  <p> Having been curious about why there are few colors around society, I gathered all colorful objects from people around me. Red trousers, blue socks, yellow t-shirts, green box and so on. </p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <p>Furthermore, I planned a special event that visitors could put on various color lipsticks. People could put <font color = "green">green </font>, <font color = "yellow">yellow </font>,  <font color = "blue">blue </font>, black, white lipsticks on their lip and leave kiss mark as a visitor's signature.</p> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""> <img src="img/portfolio/colorful4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">  <p>At the end of the exhibition, the collection of the kiss mark showed a variety in our society. The <i>colorful lips</i> pointed out the diverse characteristics each individual have. By the colorful lips event, I could figure out one conclusion. Searching for the reason why there is so little color was a wrong approach. Colors were everywhere, but it is the prejudice that lips have to be 'red' or something close to red. It was the bias what makes the 'norm' colors.</p>
