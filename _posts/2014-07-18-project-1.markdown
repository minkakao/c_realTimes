Inducing sympathy from people by showing Billy's everyday life. 2. Making them think that it is too similar to their life 3. Help them get rid of the stress by making people laugh and look back life from one step further.</b></k></li> <p>In the morning, I went to a cafe. People were lined up waiting for the coffee. At some moment it looked like zombies waiting for treatments. People were barely moving their body by waking up their brain relying on the caffeine of the coffee. Curiosity came into my mind. Why does everyone look so dead?? Is it their fault to be exhausted, stressed, and sleepy? Korea is the world's 6th biggest coffee consumption country. The number of cafes increased as Korea developed. However, paradoxically, people get more and more stress and lack of sleep these days. Let's look back from our life to society by making a puppet that shows everyday-life of a normal person on these days. </p> <br> <p>In Korea, competitive mood is all over the country. The competition starts at school. Since it is extremely tough to get into a good university, high school students study from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. at a school. They even get private-tutoring after school to get a good score on the national test that is held once a year. The test score is evaluated relatively to other students. Even though you get into a college by hardworking, the other stage opens called "preparing to get a job". Since it is tough to get a job these days, college students have to study hard and work hard. Doing a part-time job, studying, and joining various activities to get into a company. So they wake them up with coffee every day. Even after you got a job, you cannot get away from competitive, hard-working atmosphere. Too much work, little time.</p><br> <p>The Billy Story shows various things that give stress to people. </p>  <img src="img/portfolio/8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Winner Takes All">  <img src="img/portfolio/9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Bus Hell">  <img src="img/portfolio/11.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="USB Always Doesn't Work at Important Moment"> <img src="img/portfolio/13.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Interview">  <img src="img/portfolio/14.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Execution by the Paper-guillotine">
