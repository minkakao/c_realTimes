description: <h4>Independent Shadow </h4> <b>Making distance from an ego </b><br> <p>When a viewer stands in front of the artwork, the shadow of the viewer would be projected on a wall. The shadow does not imitate the behavior of the viewer but moves by itself. The viewer experience the sense of difference by the shadow’s autonomous act, deconstructing the fact that shadow reflects the silhouette of an object. </p> <br> <p>What if you lift right hand, but the shadow of yourself lifts a left hand? In a scene of 《Peter Pan》, Wendy sews the shadow of Peter pan because it moves by itself. Even Wendy and Peter pan could meet each other because the shadow of Peter pan ran into Wendy’s room. The story depicts that the shadow has independence and autonomous.</p> <br> <p>What if a shadow run away from me? It was the concern I had when young. The anxiety came from the imagination that the shadow would have the place that it wants to go. Worrying if I am restricting shadow’s behavior because I looked shadow as an independent object. The artwork leads the viewer to imagine that shadow moves by itself, deconstructing the very obvious fact that shadow reflects the behavior of you. </p> <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQs696-QDS4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
