description: <li><h5>You Will Need</h5><b> = Enough time to look into Billy's Life.</b></k></li> <li><h5>The Purpose of the Exhibition </h5><b><br>1. Inducing sympathy from people by showing Billy's that it is too similar to their life <br>3. Help them get rid of the stress by making people laugh and look back life from one step further.</b></k></li> <br><p>In the morning, I went to a cafe. People lined up waiting for the coffee. <b>At some moment it looked like zombies waiting for treatments.</b> People were barely moving their body by waking up their brain relying on the caffeine from the coffee. Curiosity came into my mind.  Why does everyone look so dead? Is it their fault to be exhausted, stressed, and sleepy? Korea is the world's 6th biggest coffee consumption country. The number of cafes increased as Korea developed. However, paradoxically, Koreans get more and more stress and less sleep then old days. I want to look back from our life to society by making a puppet that shows everyday-life of a normal person on these days.</p> <br> <p>In Korea, competitive mood is all over the country. The competition starts from teenager. It is extremely tough to get into a reputational university. So high school students study from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. at a school. They even get private-tutoring after school to get a good score on the national test that is held once a year. The test score is evaluated relatively to other students. </p><p>However, it does not end even though you get into a college . The other stage opens called "preparing to get a job". College students do a part-time job, study, and join various activities to get into a company. They wake themselves up by a cup of coffee every day. Even after you got a job, you cannot get away from competitive, hard-working atmosphere. A company force you to run.  <b>Too much work, little time.</b></p><br> <p><h5>The Billy Story shows everyday-life of a normal person. </h5> </p>   <img src="img/portfolio/8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Winner Takes All">Winner Takes All <br> <br> <img src="img/portfolio/9.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Bus Hell">Bus Hell <br> <br>  <img src="img/portfolio/11.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="USB Always Doesn't Work at Important Moment">USB Always Doesn't Work at Important Moment <br> <br> <img src="img/portfolio/13.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Interview">Interview Pressure<br> <br>   <img src="img/portfolio/14.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Execution by the Paper-guillotine">Execution by the Paper-guillotine
